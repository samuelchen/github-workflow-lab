   Snippet: There were more than 600 million conversations between people and businesses every day on our platforms. To give you a sense of what this could look like when it's scaled globally, every week now, more than 60% of people on WhatsApp in India message a business app account.
 - Source : META's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: Our revenue from click-to-message ads in India has doubled year-over-year. And I think that this is going to be a really big opportunity for our new business AIs that I talked about earlier that we hope will enable any business to easily set up an AI that people can message to help with commerce and support.
 - Source : META's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: Today, most commerce and messaging is in-countries where the cost of labor is low enough that it makes sense for businesses to have people corresponding with customers over text and in those countries like Thailand or Vietnam, there's a huge amount of commerce that happens in this way, but in lots of parts of the world, the cost of labor is too expensive for this to be viable but with business AIs, we have the opportunity to bring down that cost and expand commerce in messaging into larger economies across the world. So making business AIs work for more businesses is going to be an important focus for us into 2024.

   Snippet: Family of Apps other revenue was $293 million in Q3, up 53% driven by strong business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business platform.
 - Source : META's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: Here, our focus is on continuing to drive marketing performance for businesses, including through business messaging. There are four areas of this work. Improving reels monetization, creating engaging on-platform ad experiences, making it easier for advertisers to connect their marketing data and increasingly leveraging AI across our ad systems and products.
 - Source : META's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: We're progressing on our work to enable further down-the-funnel conversions and longer-term, we're excited about the potential of AI to help businesses message with customers more efficiently at-scale.
 - Source : META's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: We've recently started testing AI capabilities with a few partners and will take our time to get the experience right, but we believe this will be a big unlock for business messaging in the future. We're also excited about the potential for paid messaging which serves as a nice complement to click-to-messaging ads by helping businesses develop ongoing relationships with customers once they're in a messaging thread.
 - Source : META's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: Of course, whenever there's more engagement in the apps, that creates the opportunity for more monetization so there's that – on the monetization side, and then the other big opportunity on monetization which I talked about up front is just business messaging. One of the big things that I think is a key unlock for making the business messaging, for making that business model work around the globe is effectively making it so that businesses in countries where there's a higher-cost of labor, can have an AI that can respond to messages from people so that way it's not cost prohibitive for them to engage in that type of interaction with customers.
 - Source : META's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: So, I think that if we can – as we are able to rollout the business AIs, I think that that can really unlock and grow the business messaging business in a big way, but we have a lot of work to do to get there, so that's kind of a basic view on how I think this will affect the engagement in business.
 - Source : META's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: On the messaging side, I think that the way that we're looking at these AIs kind of ties into that directly where you'll be able to message with Meta AI or any of these different AIs, whether it's for fun, you have a question about something, you want help doing something, you want to play a game or you want to message with a business for commerce or you want to engage with your favorite creator and they wouldn't normally otherwise have time to message you back, but now they have an AI representing them that can, I think that that will accrue to kind of – to messaging behavior.

   Snippet: So overall, that's sort of a truism, as you know well, looking to grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses as we're focused on delivering sustainable financial value. And so that really takes us to the work streams, which I tried to tick through. Again, those remain the driver. They're the real priority. Those are the efforts that are going to enable us to expense growth. And it's moderated as possible while supporting the investment growth that is so exciting in front of us, in particular, around AI.
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q2
   Snippet: We've been saying for some time that we are focused on revenue growth ahead of expense growth and achieved that for the first in some time, and that is cost of sales plus operating expense overall. And we do remain very focused on durably reengineering our cost base.
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: And as we have said repeatedly, we want to ensure that expense growth is not growing out of revenue growth, and that means driving revenue growth and really being as disciplined as we can on these various work streams that we've discussed earlier in this call and last quarter as well to improve our expense growth trajectory.
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: when we talk about being focused on delivering sustainable financial value, that obviously means that expense growth cannot be growing ahead of revenue growth. And we're focused on revenue upside as well as durable changes to the expense base to really ensure we have the capacity to invest in that growth. nd clearly, the emphasis of revenue growth, there's a lot that's exciting ahead of us within Google Services, all of the AI advancements that are improving advertiser ROI and the search user experience and more broadly, as we've talked about across the key product areas.
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: And then very importantly, on expense growth, we have a very strong commitment to -- we keep emphasizing durably reengineer our cost base, and that will benefit all of the segments across Alphabet. And the key components, slowing the pace of hiring as a starting point, product prioritization across Google, as Sundar said, is key.

   Snippet: And then about a year ago, Philipp and Ruth started talking about some of the brand advertising headwinds that YouTube was facing. As we start to lap those headwinds, how should we be thinking about a broad recovery in brand advertising versus elements of still headwinds that are being faced in the broader ad space, specifically with YouTube?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: Two, if I can. First, as we just think about the rollout of SGE across the user base, like how far along is that? And how do you balance the product rollout and consumer uptake versus monetization in that transition?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: And then the second one, also sort of generative AI related, how quickly are you guys finding new ways of optimizing whether that's shrinking model sizes, chip efficiencies or anything else?

 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: Two questions, if I may. First, how do you think about the future structure of AI-driven Search capabilities? Will activity remain centralized in a search bar or will it be decentralized and present in many different applications, including on third-party applications? You alluded to Bard being integrated into multiple Google experiences earlier in the call.

 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q2
   Snippet: Maybe one for Sundar and one also for Ruth. Sundar, can you talk a little bit about elements of open source versus closed and things like custom silicon and how you're thinking about AI offerings broadly developing over the next couple of years and what you see as some of the key differentiation points that Google, either through the cloud business or the consumer offerings, are going to bring to market, and how we should think about differentiation playing out to a greater degree in AI in the years ahead. That would be number one.

   Snippet: I wanted to just follow up on the -- some of the SGE questions and just get a sense -- I know it's early, but what are you seeing in terms of monetization? And how do you guys think about that as you scale up the deployment of SGE? Is that -- I think there's a lot of concern out there that maybe in the short term, it's a bit of a headwind. But over the longer term, maybe query growth from a more useful product can kind of make up for that. But how do you guys see that playing out? And what can you share there?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q2
   Snippet: Great. Just ask about the Cloud. It really looks like revenue growth stabilized despite optimization. So could you talk about the pipeline and the client wins in the quarter, how you felt about those.

If you step back, you're seeing real size now of weakness in linear TV, ad agencies, small and digital companies were all slowing, and the macro backdrop is definitely cloudy, yet you guys have accelerated your growth this quarter. What factors are you looking at? Do you see that would identify why are you growing while others are really struggling and slowing down?

 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q2
   Snippet: Okay. Actually, I'll follow up on that last question, Philipp. You pointed out AI has been used to improve the advertising mousetrap at Google for many years. Do you view generative AI as just a material accelerant of your ability to improve return on ad spend for the millions of marketers who use Google?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q2

   Snippet: I have 2. First one for Sundar. Sundar, I guess as you think over the course of the next 12 months, I know you have a lot of new AI tools to show us, what new behavior changes or capabilities are you most excited about for users, developers and advertisers as these tools come out?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: And then the second one for Ruth. Could you talk to us about how much of the AI tools have you incorporated internally to sort of drive more productivity out of your engineers, your sales force, your G&A? Or is that sort of something to come over the next couple of years?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: One for Sundar and then one for Ruth. Sundar, just as you think about integrating Bard into your Search products over time, can you just talk more about what percentage of Search queries you think would utilize large language model-type responses? And how should we think about the cost of running Search on these models relative to today?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: Maybe 2, if I could, first on cloud. Obviously, one of the dominant themes, and you touched upon it, is this client optimization theme that's going on broadly in cloud computing. Can you give us a little bit more of your perspective on where we are in terms of the optimization theme broadly in cloud computing as a headwind to either revenue growth or backlog growth compared to the tailwinds of broader long-term consumption growth and, possibly, the contribution of AI initiatives to cloud computing growth?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: And then second on YouTube, obviously, you've seen a lot of success with respect to engagement and consumption on Shorts. Can you give us an update on where we are on monetization in Shorts compared to the consumption you've already seen in usage shifts?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: I'll just ask a tough question. Sundar, you came up in a group that structured a lot of the Android partnerships from inception and I believe possibly the iOS agreement as well. So how do you feel about Alphabet's ability to maintain the unit economics with these partnerships in light of Microsoft's ambitions to increase its share of paid search? And Ruth, does this have any impact on your outlook for profitability of overall Alphabet over the long term?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: Maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, you got the cost question on learning language models into Search. Can you talk about revenues? I think, on one hand, you'll see better relevancy and maybe better results with higher conversion. But on the other hand, there might be fewer areas for ads or fewer queries because people get answers more quickly. Are you optimistic on that transition? Maybe give us your thoughts there.
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: I have one for Philipp and one for Ruth. Philipp, we're trying to get under the hood on Search advertising and trying to understand changes in demand between sellers of goods and sellers of services. Can you give us any help looking at the service side? Has demand returned back to pre-pandemic levels? And then in terms of goods and e-commerce, have you seen a slowing of demand? Anything you can help us kind of put this -- level set it back to maybe pre-pandemic levels to understand services versus goods demand?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: And then for Ruth, on the terms of efficiency and being more diligent, how does the significantly higher cost of capital impact the way you're managing and evaluating the Other Bets assets? Anything there on how you may be rethinking some of the Other Bets? And what are you doing in changing some of the structures about the Other Bets assets?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: Can I try 2 questions, please? I think, Philipp, you talked about kind of a more of a pullback in network ad revenue versus Search and YouTube. Do you have any thoughts on why that was the case?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: And then Ruth, the Cloud business, even with the accounting changes, saw this very steady march towards profitability. You turned the corner now. You talked about growing the business for long-term profitability. But are there any reasons why we wouldn't -- why they shouldn't be sustainably profitable kind of starting from here as the business continues to scale? Or could it be that, that profitability could be wobbly for a while before it's sustainably profitable, that segment cloud?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: Two for me as well. I guess, first, Sundar, the consolidation of the AI teams, I think you talked about that helping to accelerate innovation. So I'm curious, specifically with that consolidation, what are the product milestones that we should look out for related to that?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: And then Philipp, regarding your comments on retail, specifically on shopping and payments, how should we think about that evolving across the platform this year? Maybe similarly, what are some milestones we should look out for on that front?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: I have 2. The first one around AI and sort of the cost of AI. I appreciate all the color about all the AI tools that are to come. I guess, first question is, how should we think about the potential impact on CapEx, and the higher compute intensity of these AI tools to come potentially impacting margins over the next couple of years?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: I have 2. For Sundar and Philipp, you both mentioned the NFL in your remarks and the opportunities it opens up. Can you comment and help us define what do you see is that longer-term opportunity? Why is it so critical to have the NFL? Is this the first of many sports deals to be had? So anything to just help us why this is so important to you.
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: And then just, Philipp, you've said in the past about the scaling of monetization, YouTube Shorts. What are the sticky factors? What's taking time to really bring advertisers on? And what are some of the things you've seen in terms that you've solved to make this a more quickly monetizable product?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: One for Sundar and one for Ruth. For Sundar, can you just talk more about how you can bring the AI products to market with the principles and integrity that you talked about, and how you can do that without kind of sacrificing quality or trust along the way?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: Maybe 2, if I could. Sundar, for you, continuing on the AI theme, how do you think philosophically about capturing the opportunity set that you see in front of you, given all the investments you've made over the last 5-plus years that we've been talking about going back to a lot of Google I/Os versus potentially disrupting the user experience or the monetization arc in your existing product set and striking the right balance between the opportunity set and being disruptive to yourself when you think about looking forward over the next couple of years?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: Just digging into Search kind of low single-digit growth ex FX. Can you talk about the pressures there, volume versus pricing or CPCs? What's really driving the slowdown?

Any stabilization in growth rates you can talk about or how your outlook is for '23 on that?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: Just a question on the hardware business. Pixel's doing quite well, but it seems like there have been issues around other areas with this inventory write-down. So could maybe you guys just talk about, in your mind, the strategic importance of having the wide range of hardware products that you have in that segment as it relates to your overall AI initiatives?
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: I'll just ask 1 question on, Ruth, you mentioned a couple of times getting Google Cloud to profitability. And just talk through how that gets done. You had almost 40% growth in Google Cloud. The operating loss level stayed about the same from '21 to '22, so the growth is there. What are the factors that need to be solved in order to get pretty nice profitability out of that segment sort of anywhere akin to what Azure and AWS have been able to show over the years?

The great feedback we've gotten so far in the YouTube experience is very, very significant. People love the navigation. They love multi-view, they love the chats and the polls. And frankly, people are very happy with the lack of latency here. The #1 piece of concrete feedback the team has gotten is actually that people want the ability to pick their own games from multi-view, which is multi-view is the awesome feature we started rolling out on YouTube TV, that gives sense to the ability to basically watch multiple streams at once. And yes, overall, the teams are working hard to build a fantastic experience, and we are really trying to stay focused on getting our first season right and providing the best possible experience really for fans here.

   Snippet: The vast majority of the dedicated large-scale AI factories standardize on InfiniBand, and the reason for that is not only because of its data rate and not only just the latency, but the way that it moves traffic around the network is really important. The way that you process AI and a multi-tenant hyperscale Ethernet environment, the traffic pattern is just radically different. And with InfiniBand and with software-defined networks, we can do congestion control, adaptive routing, performance isolation and noise isolation, not to mention, of course, the data rate and the low latency and the very low overhead of InfiniBand that's a natural part of InfiniBand. And so, InfiniBand is not so much just a network. It's also a computing fabric.
 - Source : NVDA's earning call transcript 2024-Q3
   Snippet: We put a lot of software-defined capabilities into the fabric, including computation. We'll do 40-point calculations and computation right on the switch and right in the fabric itself. And so, that's the reason why that difference in Ethernet versus InfiniBand, where InfiniBand versus Ethernet for AI factories is so dramatic. And the difference is profound, and the reason for that is because you've just invested in a $2 billion infrastructure for AI factories. A 20%, 25%, 30% difference in overall effectiveness, especially as you scale up is measured in hundreds of millions of dollars of value. And if you were renting that infrastructure over the course of four to five years, it really, really adds up. And so, InfiniBand's value proposition is undeniable for AI factories.

   Snippet: The capability of Grace Hopper is really quite spectacular. It has the ability to create computing nodes that simultaneously has a very fast memory as well as very large memory in the areas of vector databases or semantic search, what is called RAG, retrieval augmented generation, so that you could have a generative AI model, be able to refer to proprietary data or factual data before it generates a response. That data is quite large, and you could also have applications or generative models where the context length is very high. You basically stored an entire book into its system memory before you ask your questions, and so the context length could be quite large. This way, the generative models have the ability to still be able to naturally interact with you, on one hand. On the other hand, be able to refer to factual data, proprietary data, or domain-specific data, your data and be contextually relevant, and reduce hallucination. And so, that particular use case, for example, is really quite fantastic for Grace Hopper.

   Snippet: There's also proprietary AI, because the software companies like ServiceNow and SAP and there are many, many others, can't afford to have their company's intelligence be outsourced to somebody else. And they are about building tools, and on top of their tools, they should build custom and proprietary and domain-specific co-pilots and assistants that they can then rent to their customer base. They're sitting on a gold mine. Almost every major tools company in the world is sitting on a gold mine, and they recognize that. They have to go build their own custom AIs. We have a new service called an AI foundry, where we leverage MVF capabilities to be able to serve them in that.

   Snippet: Toshiya, thanks for the question. There is a glaring opportunity in the world for AI foundry, and it makes so much sense. First, every company has its core intelligence. It makes up our company, our data, our domain expertise. In the case of many companies we create tools, and most of the software companies in the world are tool platforms, and those tools are used by people today. And in the future, it's going to be used by people augmented with a whole bunch of AIs that we hire. And these AI platforms just got to go across the world and you'll see, and we've already announced a few, SAP, ServiceNow, Dropbox, Getty, many others are coming. And the reason for that is because they have their own proprietary AI. They want their own proprietary AI. They can't afford to outsource their intelligence and hand out their data and hand out their flywheel for other companies to build the AI for them. And so, they come to us.

   Snippet: We're also partnering broadly to scale this next generation of AI to more customers. Snowflake, for example, will increase its Azure spend as it builds new integrations with Azure OpenAI. And KPMG has announced a multibillion-dollar commitment to our cloud and AI services to transform professional services.

   Snippet: Even if you look during optimization times in this difficult economy, customers have really noticed how AWS leaned in with them for the long term. And I think that matters to customers. And then we have a $92 billion revenue run rate business where 90% of the global IT spend still resides on premises. And if you believe like we do, that equation is going to flip. There's a lot more there for us.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: I mean now you have to get perspective. My perspective is that the cloud is still in the early stages. If you think about 90% plus of the global IT spend being on-premises, where I think that equation is going to flip in 10 years.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: That got stalled in 2023 because companies were being more conservative with their spend and wary of an uncertain economy. And so I think that what you'll see increasingly is that companies will both go back to those transformations they were planning on making and working with a lot of systems integrator partners as well as ourselves as well as start to see the production in large scale of the generative AI applications that they're all working on and prototyping and starting to deploy into production.
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: On Cloud, maybe what I would say is, overall, we had definitely started seeing customers looking to optimize spend. We leaned into it to help customers given some of the challenges they were facing. And so that was a factor. But we are definitely seeing a lot of interest in AI. There are many, many projects underway now. Just on Vertex alone, the number of projects grew over 7x. And so we see signs of stabilization, and I'm optimistic about what's ahead.
 - Source : MSFT's earning call transcript 2023-Q3
   Snippet: First is optimizations do continue. In fact, we are focused on it. We incent our people to help our customers with optimization because we believe, in the long run, that's the best way to secure the loyalty and long-term contracts with customers when they know that they can count on a cloud provider like us to help them continuously optimize their workload.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2023-Q2
   Snippet: As the economy has been uncertain over the last year, AWS customers have needed assistance cost optimizing to withstand this challenging time and reallocate spend to newer initiatives that better drive growth. We've proactively helped customers do this. And while customers have continued to optimize during the second quarter, we've started seeing more customers shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. As a result, we've seen AWS' revenue growth rate stabilize during Q2 where we've reported 12% year-over-year growth.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2023-Q2
   Snippet: And when customers start to -- that cost optimization work, they can take some of their spend down for a while as they do that, and we help them do that and has been part of our DNA ever since we started AWS.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2023-Q2
   Snippet: there's a lot of new functionality coming out with -- and there's a lot of spend that will be in this area for all the great solutions that are out there for generative AI and large language models as well as machine learning solutions that we've always had for customers. So optimistic and starting to see some good traction with our customers' new volumes.

   Snippet: Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $8 billion for the quarter, up 28%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries and products. That being said, we saw a continued moderation in the rate of consumption growth as consumers optimize their spend.
 - Source : MSFT's earning call transcript 2023-Q2
   Snippet: Just as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we are now seeing them optimize that spend.
 - Source : MSFT's earning call transcript 2023-Q2
   Snippet: In this environment, we remain convicted on 3 things. This is an important time for Microsoft to work with our customers, helping them realize more value from their tech spend and building long-term loyalty and share position while internally aligning our own cost structure with our revenue growth. This, in turn, sets us up to participate in the secular trend where digital spend as a percentage of GDP is only going to increase. And lastly, we're going to lead in the AI era, knowing that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts.
 - Source : MSFT's earning call transcript 2023-Q2
   Snippet: While customers are more cautious in their spend, we also have the opportunity to improve our execution, given our strong position in global growth markets. In commercial bookings, with a declining expiry base and the strong prior year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to be relatively flat year-over-year.
 - Source : MSFT's earning call transcript 2023-Q2
   Snippet: What we see is optimization and some cautious approach to new workloads and that will cycle through, but we do fundamentally believe on a long-term basis, as a percentage of GDP, tech spend is going to go up.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: Across the geographies we serve, customers appreciate our focus on staying sharp on pricing, having strong selection and easier convenience, including delivery speeds, which continued to improve throughout the first quarter. That said, the uncertain economic environment and ongoing inflationary pressures continue to be a factor, and we believe it's continuing to drive cautious spending across consumers. This means our customers are looking to stretch their budgets further and are focused on value.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: As expected, customers continue to evaluate ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to these tough economic conditions in the first quarter. And we are seeing these optimizations continue into the second quarter with April revenue growth rates about 500 basis points lower than what we saw in Q1.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: In AWS, what we're seeing is enterprises continuing to be cautious in their spending in this uncertain time. Customers are looking for ways to save money however they can right now. They tell us that most of it is cost optimizing versus cost cutting, which is an interesting distinction because they say they're cost optimizing to reallocate those resources on new customer experiences. One of the great attributes of the cloud is that you can scale seamlessly up or down as demand dictates, which is not the case with on-premises infrastructure.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: Customers want help finding ways to spend less during this challenging time, and given that it's best for customers long term, we've been actively helping customers make these adjustments.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: The new customer pipeline looks strong. The set of ongoing migrations of workloads to AWS is strong. The product innovation and delivery is rapid and compelling, and people sometimes forget that 90-plus percent of global IT spend is still on-premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it's going to move to the cloud and having the cloud infrastructure offering with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, the best security and operational performance and the largest partner ecosystem bodes well for us moving forward.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: I think it's important to remember that customers are pretty explicitly telling us that this is not a cost-cutting effort where we intend on spending less money on technology or on the cloud. This is our reprioritizing what matters most to our business at this time and trying to reallocate resource so we can build new customer experience of the change what's possible.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: I think it's important to remember that there's still so much growth ahead of the cloud, 90-plus percent of the global IT spend is on premises. And so if you believe that equation is going to flip, it's mostly moving to the cloud.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2023-Q1
   Snippet: The reality, by the way, is that most people are spending most of their time and money on the training. But as these models graduate to production, where they're in the apps, all the spend is going to be in inference. So they both matter a lot.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: We've seen that during periods of economic uncertainty, consumers are very careful about how they allocate their resources and where they choose to spend their money.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rates slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions. As expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and we spend a lot of our time trying to help them do so.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: I think pricing being sharp is always important. But particularly in this type of uncertain economy, where customers are very conscious about how much they're spending, having the millions of deals that we put together with our selling partners in the fourth quarter was an important part of the demand that you saw, and we'll continue to work really hard on being sharp on pricing.
 - Source : AMZN's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: So I think it's also useful to remember that 90% to 95% of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And if you believe that, that equation is going to shift and flip, I don't think on-premises will ever go away, but I really do believe in the next 10 to 15 years that most of it will be in the cloud if we continue to have the best customer experience, which we have to work really hard at an event which we're working to do. It means we have a lot of growth in front of us in the AWS business.
 - Source : GOOG's earning call transcript 2022-Q4
   Snippet: It's clear that after a period of significant acceleration in digital spending during the pandemic, the macroeconomic climate has become more challenging.

   Snippet: Our Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last month, where we introduced Azure Health Data Services to unify disparate clinical imaging and med tech data. Cleveland Clinic will use the solution to normalize data from different systems and integrate insights into the clinician workflow. And with our acquisition of Nuance, I'm excited about our opportunity to apply the company's deep enterprise AI expertise to accelerate the growth of both Nuance's business and our industry clouds.
 - Source : MSFT's earning call transcript 2021-Q3
   Snippet: Thanks for the question. When I look at the industry cloud opportunities, we think of health care is a very critical opportunity for us and a huge and expansive addressable market. If you think about as a percentage of GDP, obviously, health care is significant. And fundamentally, when I think about the provider market, in particular, digital tech is going to play a huge role for every provider to do the things that they care the most about, which is improve the patient outcomes and reduce cost and reduce the burden on the physicians.
 - Source : MSFT's earning call transcript 2021-Q3
   Snippet: So that's where the Nuance acquisition is a great fit for us. We've been partnered with them. It also enhances our platform approach, Brent. What we have always done has gone into an industry with a platform and an ecosystem approach. For example, with Nuance, they've done a fantastic job of taking what's perhaps the most defining technology of our times, which is AI and applying it to health care, which is the most important application space. And they've done that again by really partnering, partnering deeply with EMR systems and the rest of the health care ecosystem, ultimately to benefit the providers.
 - Source : MSFT's earning call transcript 2021-Q3
   Snippet: And so we're really looking forward to that acquisition closing, and we're already partnered with them in our cloud. But this allows us to take that and integrate more deeply with what we're doing with Teams and some of our AI capabilities even more deeply, and we think we can add a significant amount of value, both to our partners in the health care ecosystem as well as most importantly, to the providers.

This is simply normal for -- when you've got a product with a lot of new technology or any new -- brand-new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you're trying to solve at scale.

It is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can afford.
